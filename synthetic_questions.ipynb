    "1. Precision measures how often we get useful results. If your system retrieves ten documents but only five matter, that's 50% precision. Low precision means your system wastes time on irrelevant information. Your LLM processes useless documents, and your answers suffer.\n",
    "2. Recall tells us if we're missing anything important. If twenty relevant documents exist but you only find ten, that's 50% recall. Low recall means incomplete answers. Your users miss critical information they need to make decisions."
